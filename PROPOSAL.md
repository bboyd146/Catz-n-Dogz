# Idea
We are creating an app that will allow users to post information about stray/lost cats and dogs so that owners will be able to retrieve them. If the cat or dog doesn't already have a home, there will be an option to locate the nearest shelter. In the long run, this app will be used to prevent stray animals from getting ran over in the street and/or put down by the city.
